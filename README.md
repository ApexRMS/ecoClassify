# EcoClassify

**EcoClassify** is an open-source [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/) package that uses semantic image segmentation to classify images. Both **ecoClassify** and SyncroSim have been designed and developed by [ApexRMS](https://apexrms.com/).

* See the [Home page](https://apexrms.github.io/ecoClassify/) for an overview of **ecoClassify**
* See the [Getting Started](https://apexrms.github.io/ecoClassify/getting_started.html) page to get up and running quickly

The ongoing development of **ecoClassify** has been generously supported by several agencies, including the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/), the [Ute Mountain Ute Tribe](https://www.utemountainutetribe.com/), the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), and [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html). As a result, **ecoClassify** is available as a free download.
