# EcoClassify

**EcoClassify** is an open-source [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/) base package that uses semantic image segmentation to classify images. Both **ecoClassify** and SyncroSim have been designed and developed by [ApexRMS](https://apexrms.com/). See the Home page for an overview of **ecoClassify**

The ongoing development of ST-Sim has been generously supported by several agencies, including the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/). As a result, **ecoClassify** is available as a free download.
