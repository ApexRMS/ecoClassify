## Watchtower: classify land cover with ease

**watchtower** is an open-source [SyncroSim](http://www.syncrosim.com) base package for classifying pixels of aerial or satellite imagery.

**watchtower** uses image segmentation to identify features in a image at the pixel level. Originally designed for classification of snow cover from satellite imagery, **watchtower** has been expanded to classify other land cover features including invasive species, urban agriculture, and more.
